## Software Configuration üõ†Ô∏è

This repository requires the following software tools:

- **Xschem** (schematic capture)
- **NGSpice** (circuit simulation)
- **BSIM-CMG3** (transistor model)
- **Python (Anaconda/Miniconda)** (data processing and plotting)

---

## Installation Steps ‚öôÔ∏è

### Step 1: Xschem Setup üñ•Ô∏è

#### **Requirements:**
- **C89 compiler**
- **awk** (compatible with mawk or gawk)
- **Tcl/Tk** (tested with versions 8.4, 8.5, & 8.6)
- **Xlib, Xpm**
- **bison**
- **flex**
- *(Optional)*: **cairo** (for enhanced text rendering)
- *(Optional)*: **xcb**
- *(Optional)*: **xrender**

#### **Compilation:**
```bash
./configure && make
```
For additional options, run:
```bash
./configure --help
```

#### **Running from Source:**
```bash
cd src && ./xschem
```

#### **Installation:**
You can install via:
```bash
make install
```
Or, specify an installation directory:
```bash
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/packaging
```

### Step 2: NGSpice Installation üîå

Install **NGSpice** by following the instructions on the official NGSpice website. There are no special dependencies required for installation.

---

### Step 3: Enabling BSIM-CMG3 üîÑ

To enable BSIM-CMG3 in your NGSpice environment, update the configuration files in your local NGSpice install directory:

- Locate the NGSpice configuration file.
- Modify the file to switch the BSIM-CMG setting (flip the true/false status) as required.

---

### Step 4: Python Environment Setup üêç

Ensure you have a working Python environment on your local machine. It is recommended to install **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** so you can run the provided Python scripts to process and plot simulation data.

---

## The XSchem Environment üé®

The Xschem environment is designed for effective schematic development and spice simulations. It supports simulation of circuits with up to **114 variables** using NGSpice BSIM-CMG integration.

### Key Components:

1. **Layout Environment:**
   - Provides a unified interface to connect all schematic symbols.
   - **Tip:** Make sure all connections terminate in the middle of the red pads on each transistor.

2. **Finfet Model:**
   - The Finfet model is derived from the Arizona State University ASAP PDK.
   - Spice files have been modified for compatibility with NGSpice.
   - **Important:** Ensure that the associated spice files are located in the NGSpice local run directory.

3. **Spice Symbols:**
   - In Xschem, spice commands are output on the local UI relative to the circuit layout.
   - Access the "commands" symbol through the ‚Äúplace part‚Äù tool.
   - **Note:** Most relevant circuit components can be found in the `ngspice` directory within the parts tool.

## Running Simulations & Measuring Data üìä

1. **Starting Simulations:**
   - Use the example schematics provided to familiarize yourself with the workflow.
   - Confirm that the spice file and Finfet symbol are correctly placed in their respective directories.
   - In Xschem, click **Netlist** and then **Simulate** to automatically start the simulation.
   - **Important:** It is recommended to run the behavioral schematic first as more complex simulations may take several days.

2. **Data Output:**
   - After a behavioral simulation (e.g., for a configuration like "say-besrour"), a circuit sample text file will be generated on your desktop.
   - You may need to modify the output directory in the spice command symbol.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Use the accompanying behavioral Python script to decompose and plot the simulation data.
